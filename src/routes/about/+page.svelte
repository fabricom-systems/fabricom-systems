	<section>
		<p>
			<strong>Fabricom Systems</strong> is a fictitious entity, proudly dedicated to developing 
			<em>useless solutions for problems that do not exist</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have no clients, no deadlines, and our profit is measured in saved bytes. 
			We are an experimental laboratory focused on preserving the unnecessary complexity of the past.

		<h2>The Mission</h2>
		<p>
			It all started with a simple (and stubborn) dream: developing modern software for the 
			<strong>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</strong> from 1983.
		</p>
		<p>
			Born from a pure passion for <strong>6502 Assembly</strong> and the curiosity to understand how to scrub bits 
			directly on the metal, FabriCom serves as the umbrella for reverse engineering projects, 
			DIY electronics, and 8-bit operating systems.

		<h2>Current Status</h2>
		<p>
			Our engineers (<a href="https://github.com/pedroafabri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" >me</a>) are currently working on the convergence of legacy hardware and modern tools.
			If you see beauty in black screens, terminals, and ancient chips, you are in the right place.
